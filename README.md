  <h3 align="center">Greenhouse Speed Run: Accelerating Plant Breeding with Data</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This project is a part of the New Mexico State (NMSU) Chile Pepper Institute's (CPI) research program, and is built in R to show significance of our growth chambers effect on speeding up growth factors (height, leaf/bud/flower/fruit number) through Tukeys HSD hypothesis testing.

<!-- About The Project -->
## About The Project 
The CPI program has been breeding peppers since the 1800s for improved flavor, disease resistance, increase harvest - to name a few traits. It takes us four generations of stable genetics to breed a new strain, thus tying our hands to time constraints on the duration of plant growing process. 

__But what if we could speed up the time it takes to go from planting to seed collection?__

In this project, we are exploring the significance of our controlled chamber on the speed of plant breeding through hypothesis testing and feature selection.
